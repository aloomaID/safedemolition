            <h3>Honeoye Falls, NY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Honeoye Falls (/ˈhʌniɔɪ/ HUN-ee-oy) is a village within the town of Mendon in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 2,706 at the 2020 census. The village includes a small waterfall on Honeoye Creek, which flows through the village and gives it its name. The name Honeoye comes from the Seneca word ha-ne-a-yah, which means lying finger, or where the finger lies. The name comes from the local story of a Native American whose finger was bitten by a rattlesnake and who therefore cut off his finger with a tomahawk.</p>
