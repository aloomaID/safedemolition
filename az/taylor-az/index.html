Different cities have specific regulations governing demolition activities, including permits, environmental impact assessments, and waste disposal guidelines.

            <p>There is no postal home delivery in Taylor. Residents within a certain radius of the Post Office who produce proof of Taylor residency are allocated a small PO box free of charge. Residents of Snowflake have postal delivery. Lack of postal delivery is also a problem when using services that validate postal addresses, as none will validate in Taylor.</p>
