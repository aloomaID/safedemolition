            <h3>Sebring, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Sebring (/ˈsiːbrɪŋ/ SEE-bring) is a city in south-central Florida, United States, nicknamed 'The City on the Circle', in reference to Circle Drive, the center of the Sebring Downtown Historic District. It is the county seat of Highlands County, and is the principal city of the Sebring Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2022 United States Census estimates, the population is 11,379; however, the broader Sebring metropolitan area has a population of 105,618, making it the 21st largest metropolitan area in the state of Florida. The disparity in population between the city proper and the metropolitan area is due to the relatively small size of the annexed area of the city, with most all of the landmass west of Lake Jackson technically in unincorporated Highlands County</p>
