            <h3>El Portal, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>El Portal is a village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The name is derived from the Spanish term for 'the gate', after two wooden gates that once stood as a gateway to the village. El Portal was originally annexed into the city of Miami in 1925. With the arrival of the Great Depression, Miami gave up its jurisdiction, and El Portal was incorporated as its own village in 1937. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population of El Portal was 1,986, down from 2,325 in 2010.</p>
