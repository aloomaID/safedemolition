            <h3>Spring Glen, UT Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Spring Glen is a census-designated place in Carbon County, in eastern Utah, United States. The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1878, Spring Glen was the first permanent settlement in what is now Carbon County. First settled principally by white Mormon farmers, the community became much more diverse after about 1890, when the development of the area's coal mines brought an influx of immigrants from Southern Europe and other regions.</p>
