            <h3>Buffalo Grove, IL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Before westward expansion, Native American Potawatomi tribes inhabited the present area. The name 'Buffalo Grove' comes from the English translation of the Potawatomi name for Buffalo Creek, which flows through some of the village. Initial Homesteaders sold their land to agricultural Catholic German immigrants, who established St. Mary's Church and a school. The rural area changed minimally until post-Korean War developers bought and suburbanized the region for veterans. After being incorporated in 1958, Buffalo Grove experienced a population boom for the next three decades and hosted a 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2008.</p>
