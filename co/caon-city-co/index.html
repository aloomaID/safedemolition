            <h3>Caon City, CO Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Cañon City was laid out on January 17, 1858, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, but then the land was left idle. A new company 'jumped the claim' to the town's site in late 1859, and it put up the first building in February 1860. This town was originally intended as a commercial center for mining in South Park and the upper Arkansas River.</p>
