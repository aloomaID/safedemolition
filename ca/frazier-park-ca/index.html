            <h3>Frazier Park, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The earliest record relating to Frazier Park was a report in 1854 that lumber was being produced there from Frazier Mountain trees for use at the new Army post at nearby Fort Tejon. Local historian Bonnie Ketterl Kane wrote that the mill was 'supposedly' at the southeast end of the present community. She cited another report that a Kitanemuk Indian referred to the site as Campo del Soldado (Soldier's Camp), 'which was where the soldiers stayed when they cut timber from a mountain they called Pinery Mountain, today's Frazier Mountain.'</p>
