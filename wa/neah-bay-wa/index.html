            <h3>Neah Bay, WA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Neah Bay is a census-designated place (CDP) on the Makah Reservation in Clallam County, Washington, United States. The population was 935 at the 2020 census. It is across the Canada–US border from British Columbia. Originally called 'Scarborough Harbour' in honor of Captain James Scarborough of the Hudson's Bay Company, it was changed to Neah in 1847 by Captain Henry Kellett. Kellett spelled it 'Neeah Bay'. The name 'Neah' refers to the Makah Chief Dee-ah, pronounced Neah in the Klallam language. During the summer months, Neah Bay is a popular fishing area for sports fishermen. Another attraction is the Makah Museum, which houses artifacts from a Makah village partly buried by a mudslide around 1750. Many people also visit to hike the Cape Trail or camp at Hobuck Beach. An emergency response tug is stationed at Neah Bay which has saved 41 vessels since its introduction in 1999.</p>
