            <h3>Mount Pocono, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Mount Pocono is located at 41°7′23″N 75°21′34″W (41.123012, −75.359574), and is nearly centered in Monroe County—the most southerly and centered county of the five counties containing portions of the Pocono Mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The region's valleys includes left bank tributaries of the Lehigh River in the southern half, and as the mountain ranges narrow closer to New York, are instead drained by left bank tributaries of the Susquehanna River. To the east, all Poconos ridge lines drain into the Delaware River or right bank tributaries of the Delaware.</p>
