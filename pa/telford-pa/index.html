            <h3>Telford, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Originally inhabited by the Lenape people, the area surrounding Telford began to be settled in 1719 by Mennonites from the Palatinate of the Rhine. In 1857, the town known as County Line (the area had previously been known as Hendrick's Blacksmith) changed its name to Telford after the North Pennsylvania Railroad Company (later absorbed into the Reading Railroad) named its new station there after civil engineer Thomas Telford.</p>
